Run the script ouBLindLandscNCB.m to compare theory, simulations and experimental data for Dox-dependent invasiveness of NF-BL MB231 cells.

MB231_1.1BLdataGB.xlsx is the single-cell fluorescence intensity data, 3 replicates. Columns 1-3: seeded cells. Columns 4-6: invading cells. Each sheet is a different Dox concentration.

LandscIndBL.txt is an individual invasion landscape for each lg(BACH1) level.

smLandscBL.txt is a consensus landscape estimated from individual landscapes.

xCentersBL.txt is the set of lg(BACH1) levels for the landscapes.
